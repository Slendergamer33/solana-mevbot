# Solana Sandwich MEV Bot - Devnet

This project is a **Solana-based MEV bot** designed to identify and exploit sandwich trading opportunities on the **Solana Devnet**. The bot uses a minimum extractable value (MEV) strategy, detecting opportunities where transactions can be executed between two trades to capture the price difference for profit. 

The bot is optimized for real-time execution on the **Solana blockchain** and allows users to automate sandwich trades, while providing a foundation for further development of custom MEV strategies.
